        <p>
            I am a graduate student studying natural language processing. Prior to this, my undergraduate studies mainly
            focused on website development, backend development, and computer server operation and maintenance. My
            current main job is to learn machine learning and some mathematical knowledge. I want to use more
            mathematical and statistical methods to make neural networks have better parameters and architecture design
            to achieve better results, and to make them more interpretable.

        <h2>Some Project</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
        <h3>1.project management system</h3>
        <br />
        This is a small project management system built using Spirngboot and Vue, mainly aimed at software project
        management. Having multiple roles and permission controls for software development allows each role in the
        software development process to more effectively submit development documents and code.

        <h3>2.image classification </h3>
        <br />
        As shown at the top of my homepage, my research direction is natural language processing. But it does sound
        weird, I did create an image classification system or something and deployed it on my phone. Of course, I
        currently do not have the ability to create a highly accurate network (which is able to publish papers proving
        the effectiveness of a certain image classification network). I used ResNet50 to fine tune a network on the
        dataset I collected, and due to the limited number of datasets, the accuracy was quite good. Of course, I also
        used some mathematical methods and tools to evaluate the accuracy of neural networks, and some interesting
        methods to explain this neural network.
